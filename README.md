# 3d-printing

Anything I find useful to version control about my forays into 3d printing

### Cetus 2

My first 3D printer is a Cetus2 from Tiertime delivered in 2023, and it has been quite the adventure learning with it.

After Summer 2024 I ended up starting to modify the printer for additional print projects, the changes after 2024-08-08 should not be trusted to work on a stock Cetus2 machine!
